# SWE-481-Project
This repository contains the implementation of the SWE-481 course project.  
The project is a full-stack web application developed by a student team as part of the Software Engineering course requirements.
The web application allows users to browse, search, and rent movies from the IMDb dataset.
The development of this project is divided into multiple phases. For each phase, specific instructions and guidelines will be added to this repository as the project progresses.
